# User guide

## Membership and sign-in

Open the invitation link, set a strong password, then sign in and choose TOTP, a passkey, or configured Google sign-in. TOTP includes a QR code and manual key; keep recovery codes privately. Google remains gated until credentials are configured.

My membership shows only the account's linked member: principal, income, equity, fiscal-year figures, monthly history, allocations and posted transactions. Select an as-at date and download a ranged statement. Contact email, phone and next-of-kin details can be edited; contact email is separate from sign-in email.

## Contributions

Payments offers secure hosted checkout when configured. A browser return does not confirm payment: posting follows signed webhook and server verification. Pending payments can be checked or resumed. The development simulator is labelled and collects no real funds.

For manual transfers, choose published instructions, enter amount/purpose, and create a reference before sending funds. Include it in transfer narration. Enter the actual paid date, attach JPEG/PNG/plain PDF proof up to 10 MB, then submit. A treasurer verifies the evidence and actual amount. A different approver must approve before principal is credited. Original submitted values remain traceable. Confirmation PDF is available after posting.

## Staff workflows

Members supports generated unique numbers, search, pagination, versioned edits and status changes. Accounts and roles supports invitations and reviewed role changes. Replacing an invitation invalidates the old link. Recipients choose their password; no default password is shipped.

Ledger supports current-day contributions, exact compensating reversals and prior-year close. Requests affect balances only after the required distinct approvals. Makers cannot approve their own requests. Rejection requires a reason; makers can cancel pending requests.

Investments supports exact allocation previews, reasoned participation edits, posting, actual maturity gains/losses, rollover and settlement. Approved current-day reversal retains revision history and exact income compensation. Returned drafts require fresh posting approval; active rollover dependencies must be resolved first.

Reconciliation compares current ledger equity/open investment cost with actual holdings/cash. Notes and differences are retained in an immutable snapshot. A separate approver finalizes it; changed sources require a fresh review. Bank settlement matching remains pending.

Reports exports dashboard, allocation, ledger, public member directory and authorized statements to Excel/PDF. Private downloads and report generation are audited.

## Settings, errors and development

Each financial policy has its own card. Required approvals apply to new requests; pending requests retain their original count. Online payments retain their starting fee policy. Vinette by Vinyl links to the creator's GitHub profile.

Read toast details before retrying. Stale edits require reload; money is never credited optimistically. Offline mode requests reconnection and stores no account data or receipts. DEMO memberships and simulator postings are fictitious. The local dev account's permission override still preserves maker-checker separation.

Historical corrections/unlock, imports, full recovery administration and production delivery gates remain incomplete. See PROGRESS and CHECKLIST.
